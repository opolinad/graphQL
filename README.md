## About

Development of an Apollo server for queries with GraphQL. The user interface (the query playground) is from Apollo. Best-Sellers books information was taken from the New York Times API (authors, publishers and books) and an algorithm created a database (MongoDB) with 180 books, 30 authors and 20 publishers. The project was developed in JavaScript, JWT was also used to authorize author queries and mutations. Finally, to manipulate the database, Mongoose was used
